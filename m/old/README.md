## Experiments with java as basis for mobile webapp development (obsolete)

When choosing technology for mobile app development, there were a question whether to use Java(via GWT) or JavaScript, to write the webapps. 
Within mobile web-development - when using DOM and not just canvas - the java-api and language restrictions(especially lack of first class functions) was a bit limiting: It would be possible to implement it in Java+JSNI, but making code with workarounds for mobile quirks is easier with a plain JavaScript app.
